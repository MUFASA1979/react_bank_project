          Payment systems are key elements utilized to realize monetary and
          financial stability, serving as launch pad to implement the monetary
          policy activities through a reliable mechanism that guarantees
          policies are implemented efficiently and yield the desired results,
          and authenticated/documented processes for settling financial
          transactions are properly executed. Furthermore, they are key pillars
          of economic growth, as they are among the three main areas of Central
          Banksâ€™ functions as defined by the Bank for International Settlements,
          viz. Implementation of Monetary Policy, Supervision and Oversight over
          Banks and Payment Systems. Payment systems involve many fundamental
          functions related to formulating the financial infrastructure that
          aids in realizing financial stability. Accordingly, the Central Bank
          of Kuwait constantly works to bolster the integrity and efficiency of
          these systems to stay abreast of ever-evolving payment services and
          instruments, with all that entails in terms of increasing volume and
          diversity of transactions. The aim is to ensure provision of secure
          and highly efficient payment services that accommodate the needs of
          the customers and earn their satisfaction through a set of means and
          procedures of financial payment and settlement based on an integrated
          and fortified infrastructure, to secure the integrity and efficiency
          of these systems and, hence, monetary and financial stability. Payment
          systems are generally categorized as either Large-value Payment
          Systems (LVPSs) or Retail Payment Systems.
